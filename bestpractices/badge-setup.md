# Setting Up Badges for Your Repository

> This is a guide for all possible badges. For your particular project, please go to the [readme guide](readme-guide) for the badges you need to include in your project

## Better Code Hub

-   Go to **[bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com/)**

-   Click on the `Sign in with GitHub` button

-   Log in with your `GitHub` account

-   You should now see any organizations you belong to, including your own GitHub

-   Click on the **XYO Logo**

-   You should now be able to search for your project

**If your project does not have a numerical score**

-   Then click on the `play` button to analyze the repository

-   Once the analysis is complete you should see a numerical score

-   You should also see a series of icons that indicate successful or failed checks

**Once you have completed and verified the analysis of your project**

-   Click on the `settings` wheel

-   You should see a compliance badge with your score out of 10

-   There are two methods to get the badge, we want to grab the markdown version

-   Copy the markdown version and paste it in the readme for your repository

## Travis CI

-   Go to **[travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org)**

-   Click on the `Sign in with GitHub` button 

-   Once you sign in you should see a page with a repository and its build status

-   You should also see a left side navigation with a list of the latest builds  of repositories in `XYOracleNetwork`

**Above the left side navigation, you should see a search bar which has the placeholder text: `Search all repositories`**

-   This is where you can search for all of your repositories where you have already setup a travis build

-   If you have a build for the repository you searched for, you should then be able to click on the status image next to the **GitHub** logo next to the name of the repo

**When you click on the status image, you will see a modal with the following**

-   branch - you can choose the branch you want the badge to represent, we should always select the `master` branch

-   A dropdown select with the starter selection `Image URL`

-   Select `Markdown`

-   Once you select markdown, you can copy the markdown text and paste it to your repository's readme file

## David-dm

-   Go to **[david-dm.org](https://david-dm.org/)**

-   Click on the Sign in on the right side of the navbar

-   Once you sign in, then text will change from `Sign in` to `Signed in`

-   To get your badge, your repository needs to be **public** and is `node.js`

-   Scroll down to the `Giving you badges` section  

-   You should see a paragraph and a text entry field where you can type in the **username** (which will be XYOracleNetwork) and the **repo** (which is the name of your repository)

-   Once you enter the values, the badge below should update according to status, most likely it will start as `dependencies/pending`

**IMPORTANT** This service is still in beta, so there will be moments where it is not working as intended

-   Now copy the entire URL, here is an example of what it should look like: <https://david-dm.org/xyoraclenetwork/sdk-core-nodejs>

-   Paste in an another broswer tab - this should direct you to a project dashboard page with a complete breakdown of total dependencies, which are up to date and which are out of date

-   Click on the badge image under the repo name  

-   This will bring up an `EMBED BADGE` modal

-   Keep the type as `svg`

-   Copy the Markdown version of the badge

-   Paste it to your repository's readme
